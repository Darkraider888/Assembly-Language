This repository is a work-in-progress learning and practice space for my Assembly language lab exercises and personal experimentation.
I continuously update it as I complete new lab tasks, assignments, and self-learning programs related to 8086 Assembly.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is not in its final form — it will keep growing over time.  
It includes various `.asm` programs that I write while:

- practicing Assembly basics  
- solving university lab assignments  
- learning through course lectures  
- exploring low-level CPU operations  
- experimenting with different Assembly concepts  
- reinforcing concepts taught in class  

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus

Through these programs, I am exploring:

- 8086 processor fundamentals  
- registers & memory addressing  
- arithmetic & logical operations  
- jumps & conditional control  
- string operations  
- loops & flow control  
- debugging and understanding CPU instruction execution
- and many more

## 🎓 Related to My University Coursework

This repository also supports learning outcomes from my university course, where we study:

- Assembly language programming  
- Microprocessor architecture  
- Low-level hardware–software interaction  
- Instruction set understanding  
- Efficient use of registers  
- Real lab exercises based on 8086 architecture  

So the code here reflects both **classroom knowledge** and **self-driven practice**.

## 🛠 Tools / Environment

These programs can be tested using:

- **emu8086**
- **MASM**
- **TASM**
- Any other compatible 8086 emulator or assembler

### 📝 Note

This repository reflects my ongoing journey of learning Assembly, both independently and through my university course.
Files will be added, improved, and reorganized over time as I gain more experience.
